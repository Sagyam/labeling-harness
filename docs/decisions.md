# Decisions

Each entry: the decision, why, and what it would cost to reverse.

## D1 — Postgres is the source of truth; migrations are the only schema change mechanism
Every schema change ships as an Alembic revision with a working `downgrade`. The test suite builds
its schema by running the real migrations rather than `create_all`, so a migration that works only
on paper fails the suite. **Reversal cost:** none; this is the floor.

## D2 — Sync SQLAlchemy, not async
One annotator, one browser tab. Async buys concurrency this workload does not have and costs
debuggability. FastAPI runs sync endpoints in a threadpool. **Reversal:** mechanical but broad;
would touch every service signature.

## D3 — Configuration in YAML, secrets in environment variables only
`config/settings.yaml` is committed with empty strings where secrets go. Environment variables
override YAML (`HARNESS_<SECTION>__<KEY>`), which required reordering pydantic-settings sources so
env wins over the init values carrying the YAML. **Reversal:** trivial.

## D4 — Storage behind an adapter, local filesystem as the default
The harness must be usable with MinIO stopped, so `ObjectStorage` has a local implementation and
`storage.backend` defaults to `local`. `read_range` is part of the interface rather than an
S3-specific extra, because HTTP range support in the audio endpoint depends on it. **Reversal:**
none needed; both implementations are kept.

## D5 — Frozen episode-level splits, assigned once at import
Stored in `episodes.split` from `hash(episode_id, split_seed)`. Recomputing at export time would let
segments migrate between train and test as episodes are added, which silently invalidates every
earlier benchmark. Splits are per episode, never per segment, because segments from one episode
share speaker, room and topic. **Reversal:** would invalidate all existing exports; treat as
permanent.

## D6 — Hypotheses are immutable; labels are append-only
A correction never overwrites a hypothesis, and a re-label never updates a `segment_labels` row; the
latest row per `(segment_id, label_version_id)` is current. This keeps the door open for
multi-annotator agreement work without a schema migration. **Reversal:** would lose annotation
history.

## D7 — Exactly three status fields
`segments.pipeline_status`, `annotation_tasks.status`, `segment_labels.disposition`. No fourth, and
no boolean that duplicates one. Status sprawl is how these schemas rot. **Reversal:** n/a.

## D8 — Peaks are precomputed at import, never in the browser
The UI must not decode audio client-side to draw a waveform; that is what makes an editor feel
sluggish by the fortieth segment. Import writes a downsampled min/max array (default 1000 buckets)
as a JSON object next to the clip. **Reversal:** cheap, but the latency is the point.

## D9 — Clips must be 16 kHz mono FLAC; anything else is rejected at import
The source is already lossy and re-encoding the exact audio that will be trained on is not
acceptable. Rejection happens during validation, before any row is written. **Reversal:** would
require re-importing every episode.

## D10 — All LLM and cloud-ASR inference goes through OpenRouter
OpenRouter is prepaid, which removes the possibility of a surprise invoice. The client, its retry
and dry-run behaviour and the `llm_requests` log were built before any route existed, so when the
ingestion pipeline started calling cloud ASR (D18) it inherited all three. Routes live in
`config/llm_routes.yaml`; every route named `asr*` becomes one ASR system during ingestion.
No direct calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq or Mistral, ever.
**Superseded part:** the original MVP made no LLM calls at all and shipped `routes: {}` with
`enabled: false`. Prioritization still uses only multi-system disagreement and rule flags — nothing
in scoring, policy checking or correction suggestion calls a model. **Reversal:** n/a.

## D11 — Validation by JSON Schema at the manifest boundary
`backend/app/schemas/episode.schema.json` and `segment.schema.json` are the executable form of the input
contract, checked before any write, so a malformed manifest fails loudly with an empty database
rather than half-importing. **Reversal:** none.

## D12 — Plain git hook instead of the pre-commit framework
`.githooks/pre-commit` runs ruff and pytest with the backend virtualenv. One less dependency and one
less lockfile for a single-developer project. **Reversal:** trivial.

## D13 — Test isolation by transaction rollback, against a real Postgres
The suite needs real partial unique indexes and real foreign keys — application-level checks would
not prove the constraints exist. Each test runs inside a transaction rolled back afterwards, with
`join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"` so service code can still call `commit()`. **Reversal:**
would weaken the schema guarantees the suite proves.

## D14 — A skip writes an event, but no label
The specification says every write creates a `segment_labels` row. A skip is the exception: the
annotator deferred the segment without judging the transcript, so inventing a label row for it would
corrupt every disposition statistic and every export filter that reads `disposition`. A skip
therefore writes an `annotation_events` row (`action='skip'`) and an `audit_logs` entry, sets
`annotation_tasks.status='skipped'`, and leaves `segments.pipeline_status` untouched so the next
queue build brings the segment back. **Reversal:** trivial, but it would make accept rate and
disposition counts meaningless.

## D15 — Audio is streamed with range support, never a presigned redirect
The specification allows either. Streaming is one code path that works identically for the local
filesystem and MinIO backends, keeps clip URLs stable and same-origin, and avoids leaking a
long-lived object URL. `ObjectStorage.read_range` exists precisely so a 206 costs one ranged read
rather than a full download. **Reversal:** adding a redirect later is additive; the endpoint stays.

## D16 — `/tasks/next` marks the task `in_progress`
That is what makes resume work: reopening the app returns the same task rather than a fresh one, so
the annotator lands exactly where they left off. The partial unique index guarantees there is only
ever one active task per segment, so this cannot fan out. **Reversal:** trivial.

## D17 — Elapsed time is reported by the client
`annotation_events.duration_ms` is computed from the `opened_at` the client sends, not from server
processing time, because the quantity of interest is how long the human took. An explicit
`duration_ms` in the request wins over `opened_at`, so a client that measures precisely can say so.
**Reversal:** would make the throughput baseline meaningless.

## D18 — Podcast ingestion and Cloud ASR integrated into Web UI
The external, fragile Colab GPU notebook is replaced with an in-app ingestion flow managed
entirely from the Web UI. The annotator uploads or selects a podcast audio file (.mp3, .m4a, .wav)
directly in the browser. The backend normalizes loudness and segments speech at natural pauses via
lightweight local VAD, routes speech recognition to Cloud ASR endpoints (including OpenRouter),
computes multi-system agreement and rule flags, and auto-populates the review queue. Progress,
system metrics, and debug logs stream live to the Web UI.
**Why:** Eliminates fragile Colab environments, GPU memory limits, and CLI friction. The annotator
never leaves the browser to ingest new episodes. The manifest importer stays, so an upstream GPU
pipeline remains a supported way in. **Reversal:** the importer path is untouched; removing the web
flow would cost only the UI.

## D19 — shadcn/ui components vendored into the repo, not a component-library dependency
The rule was "no heavy component library". shadcn/ui satisfies it in the letter that matters: the
components in `frontend/src/components/ui/` are source files in this repository, built on Radix
primitives, editable in place, with no upgrade treadmill and nothing to theme around. The
alternative was hand-rolling twenty accessible primitives (dialog, popover, tooltip, scroll area)
for a keyboard-first UI where focus management is the whole game. **Reversal:** the files are ours;
deleting the ones we do not use costs nothing.

## D20 — Ingestion writes per segment, not in one transaction
The transcribe stage makes one network call per route per segment. Wrapping the stage in a single
transaction would hold a pooled connection open for the length of an episode, and a failure at
segment 300 would discard 299 segments of paid ASR. Each segment commits as it lands.
**Reversal:** trivial, but it would make a long job all-or-nothing.
