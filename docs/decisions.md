# Decisions

Each entry: the decision, why, and what it would cost to reverse.

## D1 — Postgres is the source of truth; migrations are the only schema change mechanism
Every schema change ships as an Alembic revision with a working `downgrade`. The test suite builds
its schema by running the real migrations rather than `create_all`, so a migration that works only
on paper fails the suite. **Reversal cost:** none; this is the floor.

## D2 — Sync SQLAlchemy, not async
One annotator, one browser tab. Async buys concurrency this workload does not have and costs
debuggability. FastAPI runs sync endpoints in a threadpool. **Reversal:** mechanical but broad;
would touch every service signature.

## D3 — Configuration in YAML, secrets in environment variables only
`config/settings.yaml` is committed with empty strings where secrets go. Environment variables
override YAML (`HARNESS_<SECTION>__<KEY>`), which required reordering pydantic-settings sources so
env wins over the init values carrying the YAML. **Reversal:** trivial.

## D4 — Storage behind an adapter, local filesystem as the default
The harness must be usable with MinIO stopped, so `ObjectStorage` has a local implementation and
`storage.backend` defaults to `local`. `read_range` is part of the interface rather than an
S3-specific extra, because HTTP range support in the audio endpoint depends on it. **Reversal:**
none needed; both implementations are kept.

## D5 — Frozen episode-level splits, assigned once at import
Stored in `episodes.split` from `hash(episode_id, split_seed)`. Recomputing at export time would let
segments migrate between train and test as episodes are added, which silently invalidates every
earlier benchmark. Splits are per episode, never per segment, because segments from one episode
share speaker, room and topic. **Reversal:** would invalidate all existing exports; treat as
permanent.

## D6 — Hypotheses are immutable; labels are append-only
A correction never overwrites a hypothesis, and a re-label never updates a `segment_labels` row; the
latest row per `(segment_id, label_version_id)` is current. This keeps the door open for
multi-annotator agreement work without a schema migration. **Reversal:** would lose annotation
history.

## D7 — Exactly three status fields
`segments.pipeline_status`, `annotation_tasks.status`, `segment_labels.disposition`. No fourth, and
no boolean that duplicates one. Status sprawl is how these schemas rot. **Reversal:** n/a.

## D8 — Peaks are precomputed at import, never in the browser
The UI must not decode audio client-side to draw a waveform; that is what makes an editor feel
sluggish by the fortieth segment. Import writes a downsampled min/max array (default 1000 buckets)
as a JSON object next to the clip. **Reversal:** cheap, but the latency is the point.

## D9 — Clips must be 16 kHz mono FLAC; anything else is rejected at import
The source is already lossy and re-encoding the exact audio that will be trained on is not
acceptable. Rejection happens during validation, before any row is written. **Reversal:** would
require re-importing every episode.

## D10 — All LLM and cloud-ASR inference goes through OpenRouter
OpenRouter is prepaid, which removes the possibility of a surprise invoice. The client, its retry
and dry-run behaviour and the `llm_requests` log were built before any route existed, so when the
ingestion pipeline started calling cloud ASR (D18) it inherited all three. Routes live in
`config/llm_routes.yaml`; every route named `asr*` becomes one ASR system during ingestion.
No direct calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq or Mistral, ever.
**Superseded part:** the original MVP made no LLM calls at all and shipped `routes: {}` with
`enabled: false`. Prioritization still uses only multi-system disagreement and rule flags — nothing
in scoring, policy checking or correction suggestion calls a model.
**Superseded part:** "through OpenRouter" was always a proxy for "prepaid". D21 restates the rule
in the terms that actually matter and admits one direct provider on them. OpenRouter remains the
default and still carries all text inference. **Reversal:** n/a.

## D11 — Validation by JSON Schema at the manifest boundary
`backend/app/schemas/episode.schema.json` and `segment.schema.json` are the executable form of the input
contract, checked before any write, so a malformed manifest fails loudly with an empty database
rather than half-importing. **Reversal:** none.

## D12 — Plain git hook instead of the pre-commit framework
`.githooks/pre-commit` runs ruff and pytest with the backend virtualenv. One less dependency and one
less lockfile for a single-developer project. **Reversal:** trivial.

## D13 — Test isolation by transaction rollback, against a real Postgres
The suite needs real partial unique indexes and real foreign keys — application-level checks would
not prove the constraints exist. Each test runs inside a transaction rolled back afterwards, with
`join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"` so service code can still call `commit()`. **Reversal:**
would weaken the schema guarantees the suite proves.

## D14 — A skip writes an event, but no label
The specification says every write creates a `segment_labels` row. A skip is the exception: the
annotator deferred the segment without judging the transcript, so inventing a label row for it would
corrupt every disposition statistic and every export filter that reads `disposition`. A skip
therefore writes an `annotation_events` row (`action='skip'`) and an `audit_logs` entry, sets
`annotation_tasks.status='skipped'`, and leaves `segments.pipeline_status` untouched so the next
queue build brings the segment back. **Reversal:** trivial, but it would make accept rate and
disposition counts meaningless.

## D15 — Audio is streamed with range support, never a presigned redirect
The specification allows either. Streaming is one code path that works identically for the local
filesystem and MinIO backends, keeps clip URLs stable and same-origin, and avoids leaking a
long-lived object URL. `ObjectStorage.read_range` exists precisely so a 206 costs one ranged read
rather than a full download. **Reversal:** adding a redirect later is additive; the endpoint stays.

## D16 — `/tasks/next` marks the task `in_progress`
That is what makes resume work: reopening the app returns the same task rather than a fresh one, so
the annotator lands exactly where they left off. The partial unique index guarantees there is only
ever one active task per segment, so this cannot fan out. **Reversal:** trivial.

## D17 — Elapsed time is reported by the client
`annotation_events.duration_ms` is computed from the `opened_at` the client sends, not from server
processing time, because the quantity of interest is how long the human took. An explicit
`duration_ms` in the request wins over `opened_at`, so a client that measures precisely can say so.
**Reversal:** would make the throughput baseline meaningless.

## D18 — Podcast ingestion and Cloud ASR integrated into Web UI
The external, fragile Colab GPU notebook is replaced with an in-app ingestion flow managed
entirely from the Web UI. The annotator uploads or selects a podcast audio file (.mp3, .m4a, .wav)
directly in the browser. The backend normalizes loudness and segments speech at natural pauses via
lightweight local VAD, routes speech recognition to Cloud ASR endpoints (including OpenRouter),
computes multi-system agreement and rule flags, and auto-populates the review queue. Progress,
system metrics, and debug logs stream live to the Web UI.
**Why:** Eliminates fragile Colab environments, GPU memory limits, and CLI friction. The annotator
never leaves the browser to ingest new episodes. The manifest importer stays, so an upstream GPU
pipeline remains a supported way in. **Reversal:** the importer path is untouched; removing the web
flow would cost only the UI.

## D19 — shadcn/ui components vendored into the repo, not a component-library dependency
The rule was "no heavy component library". shadcn/ui satisfies it in the letter that matters: the
components in `frontend/src/components/ui/` are source files in this repository, built on Radix
primitives, editable in place, with no upgrade treadmill and nothing to theme around. The
alternative was hand-rolling twenty accessible primitives (dialog, popover, tooltip, scroll area)
for a keyboard-first UI where focus management is the whole game. **Reversal:** the files are ours;
deleting the ones we do not use costs nothing.

## D20 — Ingestion writes per segment, not in one transaction
The transcribe stage makes one network call per route per segment. Wrapping the stage in a single
transaction would hold a pooled connection open for the length of an episode, and a failure at
segment 300 would discard 299 segments of paid ASR. Each segment commits as it lands.
When concurrent model dispatch and segment processing were introduced to accelerate long episodes,
the commit-per-segment invariant was preserved via `LockedSession`, ensuring that concurrent worker
threads safely commit each completed segment independently without holding long-lived global transactions.
**Reversal:** trivial, but it would make a long job all-or-nothing.

## D21 — The provider rule is "prepaid", not "OpenRouter"; ElevenLabs Scribe is called directly
The point of routing everything through OpenRouter (D10) was never the vendor. It was that
OpenRouter is topped up rather than invoiced, so the worst outcome of a runaway ingest is an
exhausted balance the owner chose to fund. ElevenLabs bills the same way, which means sending
Scribe through a proxy would buy nothing and cost accuracy: Scribe is the only transcriber the
harness has that returns word spans and per-word log probabilities, and it is not reachable
through OpenRouter at all.

So the invariant is restated as its own justification — every provider must be prepaid — and
`app/llm/base.py` now holds the retry policy, the dry-run switch and the `llm_requests` write, so
a second provider inherits the guarantees rather than reimplementing them. Scribe's key is
`ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY` and should be scoped to speech-to-text only.

Scribe has no free-text prompt parameter, so the transcript policy cannot be stated to it in
prose the way it is to the other two. Its steering is `language_code: ne` plus a key-term list.
**Reversal:** delete the route and the client; nothing else depends on it. Hypotheses already
imported under `elevenlabs-scribe-v2` stay valid, and the word-level confidence signal disappears
with it.

## D22 — Transcribers run on synchronous endpoints; OpenRouter's Batch API cannot carry audio
Batch pricing is half the synchronous rate, so a `:batch` slug is the obvious thing to reach for
on a corpus this size. It does not work, and it fails in the most expensive possible way:

- On `/v1/chat/completions`, a `:batch` slug is rejected with `404 "This model is only available
  through the Batch API."`
- Submitted to `/api/beta/batches` with an `input_audio` part, the batch is accepted as
  `202 validating` and *then* terminally fails: `"Batch does not support this content; remove
  audio, video, file, or other non-text content parts."`

Both were verified against the live API. The second is the dangerous one — the failure is
asynchronous, whole-batch rather than per-request, and permanent, so a retry loop that treats a
non-terminal status as "keep waiting" would burn a 24-hour completion window per attempt and
surface the problem an episode late.

The harness therefore runs every transcriber synchronously and pays the full rate, and
`config/llm_routes.yaml` names plain model slugs. A test asserts no `asr*` route ends in `:batch`,
so the constraint fails at configuration time rather than mid-ingest. **Reversal:** if OpenRouter
allows audio in batch, an `api: batch` shape would need submit/poll plus retry logic that never
resubmits a terminal batch — which is why this is written down rather than half-built.

## D23 — YouTube audio is fetched server-side, from a canonical URL rebuilt out of the video id
Every episode used to arrive as an upload, which meant the annotator downloading audio by hand
before the harness could see it. `POST /ingest/youtube` moves that step inside the app: the server
runs `yt-dlp` and the file lands in the job's work directory, where an upload would have.

Three choices are worth recording:

- **The download is not a sixth stage.** It occupies the slot an upload occupies — how the source
  file arrives — and reports under a `downloading` stage ahead of stage 1. The five stages, their
  numbering and their log lines are untouched, so nothing downstream had to learn about URLs.
- **Nothing the caller typed reaches the subprocess.** The URL is parsed down to its
  eleven-character video id and a canonical `watch?v=<id>` is rebuilt from that id alone. Sanitizing
  the string instead would leave the harness one bug away from being a general-purpose fetcher for
  arbitrary hosts (an SSRF), and a URL beginning with `-` one quoting mistake away from being a
  yt-dlp flag. Dropping playlist and timestamp parameters is a free side effect.
- **The video is inspected before bytes move.** The endpoint probes first, so a private, live or
  over-long video is a 422 rather than a job that fails a minute later — and `POST
  /ingest/youtube/probe` exposes the same lookup so the browser can prefill the form. The 4-hour
  ceiling is a spend guard, not a technical limit: every `asr*` route transcribes every clip, so
  cost is linear in source duration and a mistyped link to a livestream recording is expensive.

yt-dlp is a runtime dependency of the backend and a subprocess rather than a library import, for
the same reason FFmpeg is: it is a tool with a command line, its failures are exit codes and
stderr, and its progress is lines on stdout. **Reversal:** deleting the module and the two
endpoints leaves the upload path exactly as it was; nothing downstream and no table depends on it,
beyond `episodes.source_uri` carrying a URL instead of a `file://` name for episodes ingested this
way.

## D24 — Drop Whisper large-v3 from cloud ASR; upgrade secondary to Gemini 3.8 Flash
Real-world testing showed OpenAI's Whisper large-v3 having poor performance on Nepali-English
code-switched audio. It returned text without word spans or confidence signals and produced frequent
transcription errors compared to ElevenLabs Scribe.

Whisper was removed completely from the cloud ASR pipeline, reducing transcription from three calls
per clip to two (Scribe v2 and Gemini 3.8 Flash) and halving OpenRouter spend per segment.
Simultaneously, the general LLM audio-chat route was upgraded from `google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite` to
`google/gemini-3.8-flash` (`asr_gemini_flash`), retaining its role as a disagreement signal and prompt
follower.

**Reversal:** Re-add `asr_whisper_large_v3` or another dedicated recogniser route to
`config/llm_routes.yaml`. Historical hypotheses under `whisper-large-v3` remain immutable in
`asr_hypotheses`.
